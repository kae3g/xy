## Immediate Targets
- Define the `[2 | 1 | 1]` metad
```

```26/ 
ata‚Äìdata‚Äìmetadata envelope directly in Zig.
- Keep all strings bounded or document when runtime slices are required.
- Replace the Python tweet slicer

```27/

- Thread reproducible documentation from `docs/` into the Zig struct without trailing drift.

## Guard
```

```28/ 
rails
- Enforce 100-column hard limits and format with `zig fmt`.
- Prefer compile-time assertions to trap plan/code drift early.
- Keep allocations static
```

```29/ 
; no runtime heap after initialization.
- Model future social distribution (ray\_160) as a deterministic function of this dossier.

   - Wire the tool into `build.zig` as a dedicate
