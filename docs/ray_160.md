   - Quote Helen Attho

```22/

   modern lyric journals—PG-rated, searching, sincere.
10. **Delta Checks**

    and tests green (`zig fmt`, `zig build test`).
    - Sync `ray_160.md` after each meaningful edit via `zig build

    revert, and reapply earth safely.

13. **Grain Foundations Alignment**
    - Study `vendor/grain-foundations` to adopt `GrainDevName` and
    `GrainSpace` for workspace discovery.
```

```28/ 

    - Document how the foundation modules shape Ray’s shared structs.

15. **Grain Conductor CLI**

```31/

    - `conduct make` runs the deterministic Zig build suite (tests,

3. **Port Tweet Slicer to Zig**
